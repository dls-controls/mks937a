    Moved to subversion. Updated to build for both 3.13 and 3.14 epics.
    3.14 version depends on StreamDevice2 & asyn.
    The 3.13 build is unchanged. It was not necessary to change the database files in any way to 
    get them to work on 3.14.
    The 3.14 version is based on streamsDevice-2-0 but still uses the same protocol file as the 3.13 version.
    Two applications are built 'example' and 'simulation' both can be run from xxx_st.boot files in the bin directory.
    'simulation' builds a simulation database that runs without hardware and can therefore
    be run on Linux or vxWorks.
    'example' builds a vxWorks version that runs with the real hardware or a vxWorks simulation 
    of the harwdare running on a seperate serial port and connected by a crossover cable.
    The gui is also unchanged and can still be run using example/startgui for 3.13 or 3.14 versions.

Prerequisite:
    Stream device version 1.5 or later must be used.

The Application consists of the following files:
    mks937a.protocol       - Stream device protocol file
    mks937aImg.db          - EPICS database for a inverted magenetron guage 
    mks937aPirg.db         - EPICS database for a pirani guage
    mks937aGauge.db        - EPICS database for a combination guage
    mks937aImg.edl         - EDM panel for a penning guage 
    mks937aPirg.edl        - EDM panel for a pirani guage
    mks937aImg-symbol.edl  - EDM symbol for a penning guage 
    mks937aPirg-symbol.edl - EDM symbol for a pirani guage

The example directory has files to show the application in action:
    st.cmd             - VxWorks startup script to initialise an IOC
    mks937a.sub        - substitution files to instantiate the records
    mks937a-launch.edl - EDM pannel to launch panels for the conected gauges 
    startgui           - script to start off the user interface

Simulation consists of the equivalent files:
    simulation_mks937aImg.db 
    simulation_mks937aPirg.db
    simulation_st.cmd
    simulation_mks937a.sub
