Overriding Defaults
-------------------

The vacuum gauge templates in the mks937a module contain numerous
values that were hard-coded to appropriate default values for
the gauges as they are used in the vacuum systems across the majority
of Diamond.  These values are the setpoints for the gauges and
associated alarm and limit fields.

However, there are a few applications where vacuum group have
requested the setpoint levels on particular gauges be altered.  Once
the setpoint levels have been changed, it can become necessary to
change limits and alarm levels to accommodate and change the description.

To facilitate this, whilst keeping backwards compatibility with existing
substitution files some optional macros are defined.

Optional Default Override Macros In Vacuum Gauge Templates
----------------------------------------------------------

The optional override macros use the msi default value syntax to add
macros that default to the original values coded into the templates if
no value is set, but allow the values to be overridden as needed.  The
result for substitution files that do not use the new optional macros
is an identical database (apart from additional comment lines on the
new macros).  Only default values that are already defined in the
existing template have optional override macros defined.

Three template files are involved:
mks937aGauge.template
mks937aPirg.template
mks937aImg.template

For each setpoint in a template there are 2 records with names of the
form

<device>:<name>:SETSP
and
<device>:<name>:SP
where 

<device> is the name the setpoint is applied to, not necessarily the
same as the device macro for the template and
<name> is the name of the setpoint (which is in upper case).

For example, after expansion:
BL06I-VA-PIRG-01:RLY:SETSP
BL06I-VA-PIRG-01:RLY:SP

Where the same field is set in these 2 records, they both have the same default value.

In the gauge template the setpoint is for the PIRG device and is called CTL.

In the pirg template the setpoint is for the PIRG device and is called RLY.

In the img template several setpoints are implemented for the IMG device, 
they are called CTL, RLY, PRO and RLA.

For each setpoint level, the following EPICS fields are given default values
DRVH DRVL
HOPR LOPR
HIHI LOLO (apart from in the Gauge template, which does not currently set these.)
HIGH LOW (apart from in the Gauge template, which does not currently set these.)
DESC

While some of these have the same default values they have been given
separate macros to allow flexibility in what is required to be
overridden.  

The macro names for the setpoint are in lower case and refer to which
setpoint they override, of the form 
<name>sp_level.
For example,
 rlysp_level

The remaining macros name which EPICS field they refer to

<name>sp_<EPICS_field>

For example,
 rlysp_drvh  = the DRVH field on relay setpoint records 
              (limits max value of relay setpoint)
 rlysp_drvl  = the DRVL field on relay setpoint records.
              (limits min value of relay setpoint)
 rlysp_hopr  = the HOPR field on relay setpoint records
              (high operator value - helps display set correct range).
 rlysp_lopr  = the LOPR field on relay setpoint records
              (low operator value - helps display set correct range).
 rlysp_hihi  = the HIHI alarm field on the relay setpoint record.
 rlysp_lolo  = the LOLO alarm field on the relay setpoint record.
 rlysp_high  = the HIGH alarm field on the relay setpoint record.
 rlysp_low   = the LOW alarm field on the relay setpoint record.
 rlysp_desc  = the DESC field on the relay setpoint record.

This particular example is the same for the Pirg or Img template.  A
complete list is given at the end of this file.  They also appear in
the generated doxygen documentation.

The default values in the macro definitions are identical to the
default values that were previously defined in their EPICS fields.

When constructing substitution files, some care is needed to handle a
mixture of gauges, some not using the optional macros at all and
others using different optional macros.  Once optional macros are used
in a pattern, either you have to lookup the default values and supply
those for gauges not wanting to override the default or you have to use
separate patterns, for example,

file mks937aImg.template
{
pattern {device,port,channel}
{ME01D-VA-IMG-05,ty_40_4,1}
pattern {device,port,channel,rlysp_level,rlysp_high}
{ME01D-VA-IMG-01,ty_40_3,1,1e-05,1.1e-05}
}

For a beamline signal list spreadsheet, empty cells will unfortunately
override the default value with an empty string unless the default row
value is set for that column.  Alternatively a separate FILE row and
column heading definition row can be given for standard and non-standard
gauges.

From experience so far, each gauge that needs a modification overrides
only a few of the several macros available.

For spreadsheets or substitution files that do not use or need the new
macros, no change is necessary to use the new gauge templates.
